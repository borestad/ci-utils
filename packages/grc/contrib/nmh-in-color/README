COLORIZING nmh
--------------

I've been using nmh on Linux for a few years now, it is a powerful mail
handling system maintained by a team of volunteers.  The latest version can
be found at:  http://www.mhost.com/nmh/

A few months ago I discovered grc, a very cool "generic colouriser",
written by Radovan Garabik <garabik@melkor.dnp.fmph.uniba.sk>
http://melkor.dnp.fmph.uniba.sk/~garabik/grc.html

Since I'm hooked on nmh, I decided to use grc with it.
Here's a list of the files needed:

The latest version of these files can be found at:

configs/
   bashrc-entries          Example alias entries for a ~/.bashrc file.
   conf.flists             grc config for flists command.
   conf.inc                grc config for inc command.
   conf.mail               grc config for show command.
   conf.scan               grc config for scan command.
   grc.conf-entries        sample entries for use in grc.conf
   mh_profile-entries      sample entries for use in ~/.mh_profile
   mhl.body                sample format file for MIME message body
   mhl.format              sample format file for show command
   mhl.headers             sample format file for MIME message headers
   rxvt-resources          rxvt settings from ~/.Xdefaults used for the
                           screenshots
scripts/
   viewmail                Script for viewing colorized e-mail.
   vimail                  Script to call vim in mail-syntax mode.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------

Grab nmh-1.0.x.tar.gz, and grc_0.x.tar.gz from the websites above. Read the
documentation included with the packages and install them.  Grc requires a
Python interpreter.  I tested with grc_0.81 and Python-1.5.1.

Copy the conf.* files to /usr/share/grc/ or /usr/local/share/grc/, depending
on how grc was installed.

Copy viewmail and vimail somewhere in your path, like ~/bin/.  Note vimail
does not use grc, but makes use of vim-5.x syntax-highlighting.  You may have
to modify the path to the syntax description files given in the script to
match your system.  If you only want to colorize email-viewing, or you don't
use vim to compose messages, don't install vimail.

Add the contents of bashrc-entries to your ~/.bashrc, and the contents of
mh_profile-entries to your ~/.mh_profile (look these over first, some of these
profile entries are just my personal preference).  Also, add grc.conf-entries
to /etc/grc.conf.

I recommend the use of rxvt (http://www.rxvt.org).  I've included the settings
from my .Xdefaults file in rxvt-resources (don't forget to do a xrdb -load
.Xdefaults after you put these in place).

COMMENTS
--------

The color-scheme I've used in the conf.* files is optimized for light text on
a dark background.  Please feel free to make modifications.

Enjoy!
